## API & Web Service Ideas

- **REST API Service**
  - Build a FastAPI or Flask-based REST API exposing follower/profile operations
  - Endpoints for querying follower data, analytics, and validation
  - Add authentication (API keys, OAuth) and rate limiting

- **Web Dashboard / Demo Site**
  - Create a web interface (Streamlit, Flask, or Django) to visualize follower data and analytics
  - Allow users to enter a handle and see followers, join dates, and profile info in real time
  - Add charts for follower growth, join date histograms, and domain distribution

- **Public Demo & Playground**
  - Host a public demo site for users to try the tool without installation
  - Provide example queries, sample data, and interactive documentation

## Analytics & Reporting

- **Report Generation**
  - Generate PDF, HTML, or CSV reports on follower stats, growth, and engagement
  - Batch analytics for comparing multiple accounts

- **Notification & Monitoring Tools**
  - Allow users to subscribe to notifications for new followers or changes
  - Integrate with email, Discord, or Slack for alerts

## Extensibility & Usability

- **Plugin/Extension System**
  - Design a plugin architecture for custom analytics, export formats, or integrations

- **CLI Enhancements**
  - Add interactive CLI mode (prompts, menus)
  - Support batch processing from a file of usernames

- **Data Export/Import**
  - Export/import data to/from databases (SQLite, PostgreSQL) or cloud storage

## Other Ideas
